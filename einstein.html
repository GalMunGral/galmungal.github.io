      <h1>PHYS-7125 Gravity Term Paper<br>
        Overview of Einstein-Cartan Theory of Gravitation</h1>
        <p class="author">Wenqi He, &nbsp April 2019</p>
      <h2>1. Mathematical Considerations</h2>
      <h3>1.1. Cartan's torsion tensor</h3>
        On a manifold with connection coefficients \(\Gamma^k_{ij}\), Cartan's torsion tensor is defined as
        \[ S_{ij}{}^k := \Gamma^k_{[ij]} = \frac{1}{2}(\Gamma^k_{ij} - \Gamma^k_{ji})\]
        which measures the extent to which infinitesimal parallelograms fail to close. A vanishing torsion, as the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry states<sup>[1]</sup>, leads to a unique metric-compatible connection on a (pseudo-)Riemanian manifold, which is the familiar Levi-Civita connection:
        \[ \Gamma^l_{ij} = \{\substack{l\\ij}\} = \frac{1}{2}g^{lk}\Big(\partial_j g_{ik} + \partial_i g_{jk} - \partial_k g_{ij} \Big)\]
        Here \(\Gamma\) denotes connection coefficients, and \(\{\}\) is the historic notation of the Christoffel symbols as appeared in Christoffel's 1869 paper and Einstein's 1915-1916 papers. From a purely mathematical perspective, it is not immediately obvious whether the torsion-free constraint is needed for a successful theory of gravitation. In fact, Einstein originally introduced Christoffel symbols not based on the aforementioned uniqueness theorem, but rather on his postulate that any quantity describing gravitation should depend solely on the metric and its derivatives<sup>[2]</sup>. However, even Einstein himself considered this assumption unnecessary in his later years:
        <p class="quote">
            ...the essential achievement of general relativity, namely to overcome ``rigid" space (i.e. the inertial frame), is only indirectly connected with the introduction of a Riemannian metric. The directly relevant conceptual element is the ``displacement field" (\(\it\Gamma\)), which expresses the infinitesimal displacement of vectors. ... This makes it possible to construct tensors by differentiation and hence to dispense with the introduction of ``rigid" space (the inertial frame). In the face of this, it seems to be of secondary importance in some sense that some particular \(\it\Gamma\) field can be deduced from a Riemannian metric...  (Einstein, 1955)
        </p>
        <h3>1.2. Riemann-Cartan spacetime \(U_4\)</h3>
        If torsion is included, the spacetime geometry is non-Riemannian. In terms of connection coefficients, extra terms are added to the Christoffel symbol:
        \[ \Gamma^l_{ij} = \{\substack{l\\ij}\} + S_{ij}{}^k - S_j{}^k{}_i + S^k{}_{ij} =: \{\substack{l\\ij}\} - K_{ij}{}^k \]
        The Riemann curvature tensor can be defined as usual to be the measurement of changes in vector components after the vector is parallelly transported around an infinitesimal area back to its starting point:
        \[ R^l{}_{kij} = 2\partial_{[i}\Gamma^l_{j]k} + 2\Gamma^l_{[i|m}\Gamma^m_{|j]k} \] 
        Since the definition of Riemann tensor does not depend on the particular form of connection, it is still antisymmetric in the first two and last two indices and still satisfies the Bianchi identity, although this is in general not the case for other identities. By symmetry, the Ricci tensor \(R_{ij}\) is still the only meaningful contraction of Riemann tensor, and the Einstein tensor \(G_{ij}\) can also be defined in the same way as in general relativity. However, due to \(\Gamma\) being asymmetric, \(R_{ij}\) and \(G_{ij}\) will be asymmetric in general. Riemann-Cartan spacetime \(U_4\) fits in the hierarchy of manifolds as follows:
        \[ (L_4, g) \xrightarrow{\nabla g = 0} U_4 \xrightarrow{S=0} V_4 \xrightarrow{R = 0} R_4\]
        In other words, the most general manifold equipped with a metric-preserving connection is the Riemann-Cartan \(U_4\). When torsion vanishes, it reduces to the pseudo-Riemannian \(V_4\) in general relativity. If in addition curvature vanishes, the manifold becomes Minkowskian \(R_4\).
        
        <h2>2. Field Equations of Einstein-Cartan Theory</h2>
        <h3>2.1. Motivation</h3>
        From the perspective of particle physics, all elmentary particles can be classified by the representations of the Poincar&eacute; group and be labeled by mass \(m\) and spin \(s\). \(m\) is associated with the translational part of Poincar&eacute; group and \(s\) with the rotational part <sup>[3]</sup>. With spin being such a fundamental notion that is distinct from mass, it is reasonble to hypothesize that spin angular momentum is also a source of a gravitational field. That is, spin can be supposed to be coupled to some geometrical quantity that characterizes the rotational degrees of freedom of spacetime, analogous to how energy-momentum is coupled to metric.
        <h3>2.2. Canonical tensors</h3>
        Suppose a matter field \(\psi(x^a)\) is distributed over spacetime and its action is
        \[ S_{matter} = \int \mathfrak{L}(\psi,\partial\psi, g,\partial g, S) d^4x \]
        From Noether's theorem, it can be shown that the canonical spin angular momentum tensor, defined as the Noether current for rotations (Lorentz transformations), can be expressed as the variational derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to contortion, or the non-Christoffel part of the connection <sup>[3]</sup>:
        \[\tau_k{}^{ji} := \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta\mathfrak{L}}{\delta K_{ij}{}^k}\]
        Additionally, with the following definitions
        \[ \sigma^{ij} := \frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta\mathfrak{L}}{\delta g_{ij}},
        \quad \mu_{k}{}^{ji} := \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta\mathfrak{L}}{\delta S_{ij}{}^k},
        \quad \stackrel{*}{\nabla}_k := \nabla_k + 2S_{kl}{}^l\]
        the canonical energy-momentum tensor, or the Noether current for translations, is <sup>[3]</sup>:
         \[ \Sigma^{ij} := \sigma^{ij} - \stackrel{*}{\nabla}_k\mu^{ijk}  = \sigma^{ij} + \stackrel{*}{\nabla}_k(\tau^{ijk} - \tau^{jki} + \tau^{kij})\]
        where \(\sigma^{ij}\), the variational derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to metric, is the familiar Hilbert stress-energy tensor, which alone is equivalent to the canonical energy-momentum tensor within the framework of general relativity. In Einstein-Cartan theory, however, the additional divergence term must be included to compensate for a non-zero torsion.
        <h3>2.3. Variational principles</h3>
        The field equations can be derived as always by doing a variation of the full action with respect to each independent variable, in this case \(g_{ij}\) and \(S_{ij}{}^k\). 
        The most natural choice for the Lagrangian density of gravitational field is still the Einstein–Hilbert one:
        \[\mathfrak{L}_{gravity} = \frac{1}{2\kappa}\mathfrak{R} = \frac{1}{2\kappa}\sqrt{-g} R\]
        where \(\kappa = 8\pi G\). The total action is
        \[ S = S_{matter} + S_{gravity} = \int \Big[ \mathfrak{L}(\psi,\partial\psi, g,\partial g, S) +  \frac{1}{2\kappa} \sqrt{-g}R  \Big]d^4x\]
        Varying the action with respect to \(g_{ij}\) and \(S_{ij}{}^k\) gives:
        \[ - \frac{\delta(\sqrt{-g}R)}{\delta g_{ij}} = \kappa \sqrt{-g} \left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta{\mathfrak{L}}}{\delta g_{ij}} \right) = \kappa \sqrt{-g} \sigma^{ij} \tag{1}\]
        \[ - \frac{\delta(\sqrt{-g}R)}{\delta S_{ij}{}^k} = 2\kappa \sqrt{-g} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta{\mathfrak{L}}}{\delta S_{ij}{}^k} \right) = 2\kappa \sqrt{-g} \mu_k{}^{ji} \tag{2}\]
        Using the definition of \(\Sigma^{ij}\) and equation (2), equation (1) can be written as:
        \begin{align*} 
        - \frac{\delta(\sqrt{-g}R)}{\delta g_{ij}}  &= \kappa \sqrt{-g} \left( \Sigma^{ij} + \stackrel{*}{\nabla}_k\mu^{ijk}\right)
        = \kappa \sqrt{-g} \left[ \Sigma^{ij} + \stackrel{*}{\nabla}_k \left(\frac{g^{li}}{2\kappa\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta (\sqrt{-g}R)}{\delta S_{kj}{}^l}\right) \right] \\
        &= \kappa \sqrt{-g} \left[ \Sigma^{ij} + \frac{g^{li}}{2\kappa\sqrt{-g}} \stackrel{*}{\nabla}_k \left(\frac{\delta (\sqrt{-g}R)}{\delta S_{kj}{}^l}\right) \right] \\
        &= \kappa \sqrt{-g} \Sigma^{ij} + \frac{g^{li}}{2} \stackrel{*}{\nabla}_k \left(\frac{\delta (\sqrt{-g}R)}{\delta S_{kj}{}^l}\right)
        \end{align*}
        After some tedious calculations, the geometrical terms simplify drastically to \(G^{ij}\):
        \[ - \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}} \left[\frac{\delta(\sqrt{-g}R)}{\delta g_{ij}} + \frac{g^{li}}{2} \stackrel{*}{\nabla}_k \left(\frac{\delta (\sqrt{-g}R)}{\delta S_{kj}{}^l}\right)\right] =  \kappa \Sigma^{ij}
        \quad\Rightarrow\quad G^{ij} = \kappa \Sigma^{ij} \]
        Equation (2) can be written in terms of \(\tau^{ijk}\) by an antisymmetrization:
        \[ -\frac{g^{l[j}}{2\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta(\sqrt{-g}R)}{\delta S_{i]k}{}^l} = \kappa \mu^{[ji]k} = \kappa \tau^{ijk} \]
        The left-hand side evaluates to modified torsion \(T^{ijk}\), defined as torsion plus its trace:
        \[ T_{ij}{}^k := S_{ij}{}^k + 2\delta^k_{[i}S_{j]l}{}^l\]
        Thus we have obtained the two (sets of) field equations of Einstein-Cartan theory:
        \[ G^{ij} = \kappa \Sigma^{ij} \tag{3} \]
        \[ T^{ijk} = \kappa \tau^{ijk} \tag{4} \]
        
        <h2>3. Physical Implications</h2>
        <h3>3.1. Spin-torsion coupling</h3>
        The first set of field equations simply reduces to Einstein's equations in the case of zero spin. The second equation, however, reveals the coupling of torsion to the spin angular momentum of matter field. What is significant about (4), apart from the fact that it takes on a form analagous to (3), is that it is a set of simple algebraic equations rather than differential equations, which implies that torsion can only be zero outside of matter distribution and cannot propagate as a wave through vacuum -- it is bound to matter.
        <h3>3.2. Comparison to general relativity</h3>
        Furthermore, the fact that equation (4) is algebraic makes it possible to pull out the non-Riemannian part of \(G^{ij}\) in equation (3) and substitute all \(T^{ijk}\) with \(\kappa\tau^{ijk}\), resulting in a combined field equation that involves only the Riemannian part of \(G^{ij}\)<sup>[3]</sup>:
        \[ G^{ij}_{\{\}}  = \kappa \Bigg[\sigma^{ij} + \kappa\Big( -4\tau^{ik}{}_{[l}\tau^{jl}{}_{k]} 
        -2\tau^{ikl}\tau^j{}_{kl} + \tau^{kli}\tau_{kl}{}^j + \frac{1}{2}g^{ij}\left( 4\tau_m{}^k{}_{[l}\tau^{ml}{}_{k]} + \tau^{mkl}\tau_{mkl} \right)\Big) \Bigg] \]
        Compared to Einstein's field equations, which under this notation is
        \[G^{ij}_{\{\}} = \kappa \sigma^{ij} \]
        the term consisting of various products of the spin tensor \(\tau\) manifests itself as the correction term, which obviously is very small due to the additional \(\kappa\) factor. Suppose the matter distribution is made up of polarized elementary particles with particle mass \(m\), spin \(\hbar/2\), and number density \(n\) From the combined field equation it is obvious that the mass density \(\rho = mn\) receives a correction from spin of order \(\kappa s^2 = \kappa (n\hbar/2)^2\). For spin to have an effect as significant as that of mass,
        \[ mn \sim \kappa n^2\hbar^2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad n \sim \frac{m}{\kappa \hbar^2} \]
        In terms of mass density <sup>[3]</sup>,
        \[ \rho_{critical} \sim \frac{m^2}{\kappa \hbar^2} \approx \begin{cases}
        10^{47} \, \text{g} \cdot \text{cm}^{-3} \text{ (electrons)} \\
        10^{54} \,\text{g} \cdot \text{cm}^{-3} \text{ (neutrons)}
        \end{cases}\]
        Thus, Einstein-Cartan theory only produces non-negligible deviations from general relativity under extremely high densities that might in fact be unphysical.  
    <h1>Appendix: Summary of Einstein’s 1916 Paper<br>
      <i>The Foundation of <br> the General Theory of Relativity</i></h1>
    <p class="author">Wenqi He, &nbsp; December 2018</p>
    <h2>1. Philosophical Motivation</h2>
    Near the end of the first section, Einstein states his guiding principle:
    <p class="quote">The general laws of nature are to be expressed by equations which hold good for all systems of coordinates, that is, are covariant with respect to any substitutions whatever.</p>
    <h2>2. Mathematical Aid</h2>
    Here he intentionally introduces the mathematics in a simple manner so that <p class="quote">a special study of the mathe- matical literature is not required for the understanding of the present paper</p>
    <h3>2. 1. Tensor</h3>
    Following his guiding principle, tensor are very natural objects to investigate, for that
    ...the equations of transformation for their components are linear and homogeneous. Accord- ingly, all the components in the new system vanish, if they all vanish in the original system. If, therefore, a law of nature is expressed by equating all the components of a tensor to zero, it is generally covariant.
    <h3>2. 2. Covariant and Contravariant Tensor</h3>
    First he introduced contravariant and covariant tensors and their respective transformation rules under a change of coordinates, which could be generalizes to that of mixed tensors:
    \[{A'}_\tau^{\sigma} = \frac{\partial x'^\tau}{\partial x^\mu}\frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial x'^\sigma} A^\nu_\mu\]
    Then he introduced outer product, contraction, and combining both, inner product.
    2.3 Metric
    The entire theory was built on top of the metric tensor gμν (he called it the covariant fundamental tensor) which determines the invariant line element of spacetime by
    \[ ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu \]
    He further introduces the inverse metric gμν and demonstrates that one could raise and lower indices by contraction with the (inverse) metric.    
    <h3>2.4. Geodesic</h3>
    Next, he derived the equation of geodesic by doing variation on arclength
    \[ \delta S = \delta \int \sqrt{-g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^\nu}{d\lambda}}d\lambda = 0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{d^2x^\tau}{ds^2} + \Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\mu}{ds}\frac{dx^\nu}{ds} = 0\]
    where \(\Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu}\), the Christoffel symbol, is a shorthand for a mixture of derivatives of \(g_{\mu\nu}\).
    <h3>2.5. Covariant Derivative</h3>
    In order to write what he called 
    <p class="quote">generally covariant differential equations,</p> Einstein derives the notion of covariant derivatives in the following way: Suppose \(\psi\) is invariant in spacetime. Because ds is invariant, the derivatives of \(\psi\) along the geodesic (so that the above equation can be used to simplify terms) with respect to \(s\)
    \[\frac{d\phi}{ds} = \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x^\mu}\frac{d x^\mu}{ds} = A_\mu \frac{dx^\mu}{ds} \]
    \[ \frac{d^2\phi}{ds^2} = \left(\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial x^\mu \partial x^\nu} + \Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu} \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x^\tau}\right)\frac{dx^\mu}{ds}\frac{dx^\nu}{ds} = \left(\frac{\partial A_\mu}{\partial x^\nu} + \Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu} A_\tau \right)\frac{dx^\mu}{ds}\frac{dx^\nu}{ds}\]
    must be invariant as well. In order for the derivative to preserves the tensor property,
    \[ \nabla_\nu A_\mu := \frac{\partial A_\mu}{\partial x^\nu} + \Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu}A_\tau \]
    For rank two tensor Aμν = AμBν, requiring that it follows Leibniz rule,
    \[ \nabla_\sigma A_{\mu\nu} : = \nabla_\sigma A_\mu B_\nu + A_\nu \nabla_\sigma B_\mu = \frac{\partial A_{\mu\nu}}{\partial x^\sigma} + \Gamma^\tau_{\sigma\mu}A_{\tau\nu} + \Gamma^\tau_{\sigma\nu}A_{\mu\tau} \]
    <h3>2.6. Curvature</h3>
    Einstein’s derived the Riemann curvature tensor by taking the commutator of the two covariant derivatives:
    \[ [\nabla_\sigma, \nabla_\tau] A_\mu = R^\rho_{\mu\sigma\tau}A_\rho \]
    where \(R^\rho_{\mu\sigma\tau}\) is a shorthand for a mixture of first and second derivatives of \(g_{\mu\nu}\). Then he explains the
    significance of the Riemann tensor by citing (without giving the proof) a fundamental theorem 
    \[ R^\rho_{\mu\sigma\tau} = 0 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad g_{\mu\nu} = \text{constant under appropriate coordinates} \]
    Contracting the Riemann tensor gives the Ricci tensor \(R_{\mu\nu}\). In coordinates where \(\sqrt{−g} = 1\)
    \[ R_{\mu\nu} = \frac{\partial\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\nu}}{\partial x^\alpha} - \Gamma^\beta_{\mu\alpha}\Gamma^\alpha_{\nu\beta} \]
    which he considers to be of particular interest, for that
    <p class="quote">
    ...besides Rμν there is no tensor of second rank which is formed from the gμν and its deriva- tives, contains no derivations higher than second, and is linear is these derivatives.
    </p>    
    <h2>3. Physical Postulates</h2>
    The famous summary by Wheeler:
    <p class="quote">Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.</p> 
    <h3>3.1. Equations of Motion</h3>
    The first postulate is that particles follow the geodesic
    \[ \frac{d^2x^\tau}{ds^2} = -\Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu} \frac{dx^\mu}{ds}\frac{dx^\nu}{ds} \]
    Based on this, he calls Γτμν the components of the gravitational field, since
    If the \(\Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu}\) vanish, then the point moves uniformly in a straight line. These quantities therefore
    condition the deviation of the motion from uniformity.
    <h3>3.2. Field Equations and Laws of Conservation</h3>
    <h4>3.2.1. In the Absence of Matter</h4>
    Einstein argues that the equation must be less restrictive than, but nonetheless must in special cases be reducible to, the vanishing of the Riemann tensor, for compatibility with special relativity. Thus he requires that Ricci tensor vanish:
    \[R_{\mu\nu} = 0 \]
    which he later compares to \(\nabla^2 \phi = 0\) in Newtonian gravity. He first verifies that the Lagrangian is
    \[ \mathcal{L} = g_{\mu\nu}\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\beta}\Gamma^\beta_{\nu\alpha} \]
    Then from the Euler-Lagrange equation, a divergence-free quantity arises after some calculation:
    \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\alpha}\Big(\partial_\sigma g^{\mu\nu} \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\partial_\alpha g^{\mu\nu}} - \delta^\alpha_\sigma \mathcal{L}\Big) = 0\]
    Einstein argues that
    <p class="quote">
      This equation expresses the law of conservation of momentum and of energy for the gravita- tional field
    </p>
      and gives the definition of the energy components of the gravitational field as:
    \[ t^\sigma_\sigma := -\frac{1}{2\kappa}\Big(\partial_\sigma g^{\mu\nu} \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\partial_\alpha g^{\mu\nu}} - \delta^\alpha_\sigma \mathcal{L}\Big) = \frac{1}{2\kappa}\big(\delta^\alpha_\sigma g^{\mu\nu}\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\beta}\Gamma^\beta_{\nu\lambda} - 2g^{\mu\nu}\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\beta}\Gamma^\beta_{\nu\sigma}\big), \quad t = t^\alpha_\alpha \]
   Extracting from the field equation all terms expressible in terms of \(t^\alpha_\alpha\) and its trace:
       \[\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\alpha}\Big(g^{\sigma\beta}\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\beta}\Big) = -\kappa\left(t^\sigma_\mu - \frac{1}{2}\delta^\sigma_\mu t\right) \]
    which equation, Einstein immediately points out,
    <p class="quote">
        ...is particularly useful for a vivid grasp of our subject
    </p>
    <h4>3.2.2 General Form</h4>
    Finally, Einstein argues that the contribution of matter should be analogous to the source term in Poisson’s equation \(\Delta\phi = 4\pi G\rho\). Thus he modifies the matter-free field equation by introducing the energy-tensor of matter \(T_\mu^\sigma\) and its trace \(T = T^\mu_\mu\) to the right side:
    \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\alpha}\big(g^{\sigma\beta}\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\beta}\big) = -\kappa\Big[\big(t^\sigma_\mu + T^\sigma_\mu\big) - \frac{1}{2}\delta^\sigma_\mu(t + T)\Big]\]
    Absorbing tσμ and t terms back to the left yields the well-known field equation:
    Lastly, he checks that the conservation laws still hold, that is,
    \[ \frac{\partial\big(t^\sigma_\mu + T^\sigma_\mu\big)}{\partial x^\sigma} = 0 \]
    <h3>3.3 Newtonian Approximation</h3>
    <h4>3.3.1 Equations of Motion</h4> 
    Suppose \(\Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu}\) are small quantities, and the speed of the particle is small compared to the speed of light, namely, for spatial dimensions dxα/ds are small quantities, and \(dt/ds = dx^0/ds \approx 1\). Additionally, suppose the gravitational field to be quasistatic, that is, \(\partial g_{\mu\nu}/\partial t = \partial g_{\mu\nu}/\partial x^0 = 0\), then
    \[ \frac{d^2x^\tau}{ds^2} = -\Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu} \frac{x^\mu}{ds}\frac{x^\nu}{ds} \quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{d^2x^\alpha}{dt^2} = -\Gamma^\alpha_{00} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial g_{00}}{\partial x^\alpha}, \quad \alpha = 1,2,3 \]
    This is exactly the equations of motion in Newton’s theory if we set φ = g00/2:
    <p class="quote">What is remarkable in this result is that the component \(\it{g_{00}}\) of the fundamental tensor alone defines, to a first approximation, the motion of the material point.</p>
    
    <h4>3.3.2 Field Equations</h4>
    Under the condition that \(T_{00} = T = ρ/\) and \(T_{\mu\nu} = 0\) otherwise, for \(\mu = \nu = 0 \), we can approximate both sides of the field equation as follows:
    \[ LHS = R_{00} \approx \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\alpha} \Gamma^\alpha_{00} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\alpha}\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial g_{00}}{\partial x^\alpha}\right) = \frac{\partial^2}{(\partial x^\alpha)^2}\left(\frac{g_{00}}{2}\right) = \frac{\partial^2\phi}{(\partial x^\alpha)^2}\]
    \[ RHS = \kappa \Big(T_{00} - \frac{1}{2}Tg_{00}\Big) \approx -\kappa \Big(\rho - \frac{1}{2} \rho\Big) = - \frac{\kappa\rho}{2} \]
    The field equations then reduce to Poisson’s equation for Newton’s law of gravitation:
    \[ \frac{\partial^2\phi}{(\partial x^\alpha)^2} = - \frac{\kappa\rho}{2} = \frac{4\pi G\rho}{c^4} \Rightarrow \kappa = - \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \]
    Thus, the field equations can be rewritten as:
    \[ R_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \Big(T_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} T g_{\mu\nu} \Big) \]
