## Programming Languages
We will introduce the most popular programming languages, as indicated by the TIOBE index, using the implementation of binary search for comparison of the basic control structures. Regardless of the language, you use the branching (`if...elseif...else`, `switch-case`) and looping (`for`, `while`,`do...while`) control sturctures to perform flow control, essentially describing a flowchart, with  As you will see, all these languages are essentially the same , the only differences being language-specific conventions.
### Statically-typed Compiled Languages (C-family) 
#### C and C++/C#/Java
C is a structured programming language where a program comprises standalone functions, whereas C++, C# and Java are object-oriented (OO) languages where functions are bundled with the data they modify into objects, which are constructed from templates called classes. Classes are optional in C++ but mandatory in C# and Java.
```c++
//class SomeWrapperClass {
    int binarySearch(int arr[], int l, int r, int x) { 
      while (l <= r) { 
        int m = l + (r - l) / 2; 
        if (arr[m] == x)
          return m;
        if (arr[m] < x)
          l = m + 1;
        else
          r = m - 1;
      } 
      return -1; 
    }
//} (C++ requires a semicolon here)
```
### Dynamically-typed Scripting Languages
Types are determined at run-time, so there is no type declaration in source code.
#### JavaScript
```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, l, r, x) { 
  while (l <= r) { 
    m = l + (r - l) / 2;
    if (arr[m] == x)
      return m;
    if (arr[m] < x)
      l = m + 1;
    else
      r = m - 1;
  } 
  return -1; 
}
```
#### PHP
```php
<?php
function binarySearch($arr, $l, $r, $x) { 
  while ($l <= $r) { 
    $m = $l + ($r - $l) / 2; 
    if ($arr[$m] == $x) 
      return $m;
    if ($arr[$m] < $x)
      $l = $m + 1;
    else
      $r = $m - 1;
  }
  return -1;
}
?> 
```
#### Python
```python
# In Python, blocks are indicated by indentations instead of curly braces.
def binarySearch(arr, l, r, x): 
  while l <= r: 
    m = l + (r - l) / 2
    if arr[m] == x: 
      return m 
    if arr[m] < x: 
      l = m + 1
    else: 
      r = m - 1
  return -1
```
