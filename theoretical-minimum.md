## What Is a Computer
The characteristic of the world beneath the casing of a computer is distinct from its surroundings: The physical world that constitutes our sense-experience is usually modeled mathematically as a *continuous* system, whereas computers are designed to be *discrete*, both in space (information is stored in discrete units) and time (computation is by definition a stepwise process). Fortunately, the discontinuities elude our perception when the spatial and temporal resolutions are high enough. Modern computers typically have high DPI (Dots per inch) displays with 60 Hz refresh rate, which almost perfectly disguises the discrete nature of a computer - but there is a potential problem.

## (Imperative) Programming Languages
Regardless of language, under the imperative paradigm you use branching (`if-elseif-else`, `switch-case`) and looping (`for`, `while`,`do-while`) control sturctures to direct execution flow - essentially giving a textual description of a 'flowchart' for your program, the rest are simply language-specific conventions. We will introduce the most popular programming languages, as indicated by the TIOBE index, using their respective implementations of a binary search algorithm. As you will see, their syntax are very similar and even identical in some cases.
### Statically-typed Compiled Languages (C-family) 
#### C and C++/C#/Java
C is a structured programming language where a program comprises standalone functions, whereas C++, C# and Java are object-oriented (OO) languages where functions are bundled with the data they modify into objects, which are constructed from templates called classes. Classes are optional in C++ but mandatory in C# and Java.
```c++
//class SomeWrapperClass {
    int binarySearch(int arr[], int l, int r, int x) { 
      while (l <= r) { 
        int m = l + (r - l) / 2; 
        if (arr[m] == x)
          return m;
        if (arr[m] < x)
          l = m + 1;
        else
          r = m - 1;
      } 
      return -1; 
    }
//} (C++ requires a semicolon here)
```
### Dynamically-typed Scripting Languages
Types are determined at run-time, so there is no type declaration in source code.
#### JavaScript
```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, l, r, x) { 
  while (l <= r) { 
    m = l + (r - l) / 2;
    if (arr[m] == x)
      return m;
    if (arr[m] < x)
      l = m + 1;
    else
      r = m - 1;
  } 
  return -1; 
}
```
#### PHP
```php
<?php
function binarySearch($arr, $l, $r, $x) { 
  while ($l <= $r) { 
    $m = $l + ($r - $l) / 2; 
    if ($arr[$m] == $x) 
      return $m;
    if ($arr[$m] < $x)
      $l = $m + 1;
    else
      $r = $m - 1;
  }
  return -1;
}
?> 
```
#### Python
```python
# In Python, blocks are indicated by indentations instead of curly braces.
def binarySearch(arr, l, r, x): 
  while l <= r: 
    m = l + (r - l) / 2
    if arr[m] == x: 
      return m 
    if arr[m] < x: 
      l = m + 1
    else: 
      r = m - 1
  return -1
```
