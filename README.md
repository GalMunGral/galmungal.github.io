**Subject:** [CS2340] Late Registration

> Hi Mr. Waters,

> I just registered for this class at 3pm this afternoon and so I haven't met any classmates yet. I noticed that people have already formed teams and the first team assignment has been released, which really made me panick. I just wonder if you could assign me to a team that still needs or accepts new members. I apologize for any inconveniences caused by my late decision to join the class.

> Hey Kevin, 

> This is Wenqi. I don't know if you remember me, but we were in the same ENGL1101 class a year ago. So here is the thing: I registered for CS2340 on Friday afternoon and then realized that I'm a little late because people have already formed groups and the first team assignment has already been released. I emailed the intructor but I haven't got any response yet. I noticed that you are also in CS2340 this semester, so I just wonder if I could join your team.

> Hi Mr. Waters,

> I registered for this class in the last hour of registration phase II, and I missed all the lectures last week. I sent you an email about this last night, but I haven't got your response so far so I wonder if the email was actually received. I noticed that there are some 4-person teams now due to droppings. Is it possible to put me on one of those teams?
